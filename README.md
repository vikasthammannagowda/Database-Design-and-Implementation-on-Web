# Database Design and Implementation on Web 
This course is built around a fully AI-driven workflow—leveraging large language models at every stage of the semester to guide design, implementation, debugging, and reflection on the culminating “Database Integration on Web” project.

**1. AI as the Primary “Pair Programmer”**
From Day 1, students learn how to structure effective prompts to LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Copilot) to:
1. Generate database schemas—prompting for normalized table definitions, primary/foreign keys, and access-control constraints.
2. Craft SQL queries—from simple CRUD to complex joins and transactions, students iteratively refine prompts and validate AI-suggested SQL against SQLite.
3. Scaffold back-end endpoints—using AI to produce Node.js route handlers that execute queries and enforce business rules (e.g., forbidding dual enrollment in CSI-300-01 and CSI-300-02) Project_3.

**2. AI-Facilitated Learning Modules**
Instead of traditional lectures, each week begins with an AI-moderated Q&A “studio” where students:
1. Pose design or implementation questions to an LLM.
2. Compare multiple model responses for correctness and style.
3. Critically evaluate and refine AI output—learning to detect subtle logic errors (e.g., missing ON DELETE CASCADE clauses).

These exercises sharpen both database knowledge and “prompt engineering” skills.

3. AI-Guided Project Milestones
At each project milestone (schema draft, CRUD prototype, UI integration), students:

Submit their AI-generated code snippets alongside their own edits.

Annotate differences—explaining where AI was helpful and where manual correction was required.

Peer-review classmates’ AI-interactions, giving feedback on prompt clarity and solution quality.

This continuous integration of AI into version control builds confidence in trusting—and verifying—LLM suggestions.

4. AI-Powered Debugging Labs
Weekly “debugathons” pair students with an LLM to troubleshoot:

Schema normalization issues (1NF→3NF).

Failing SQL constraints or index performance.

Front-end–back-end mismatches in React/Node.js data flows.

Students learn to craft minimal reproducible examples and use AI to step through stack traces.

5. AI in Assessment & Reflection
Intermediate deliverables consist of AI-assisted SQL scripts; teams cite the prompts they used.

Final group submission includes AI-refined React components and server code.

Individual reflections (600+ words) ask explicitly:

“Describe your experience interacting with AI to assist with code generation.” Project_3

This ensures students critically assess how AI shaped their development process.

6. Ethical Boundaries & Academic Integrity
While AI is freely permitted for all coding tasks, the use of AI to draft the user guide or individual reflection report is strictly prohibited. Any such misuse incurs an automatic F on the project Project_3. This clear demarcation teaches responsible, contextualized AI use.
